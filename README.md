SplitShow
=========

A tool for the dual-head presentation of PDF slides on Mac OS X, most likely using a laptop
and a projector. The project arose outof the need to correctly project slides created with 
[LaTeX's BEAMER class](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/).

#### Dual-Head Full Screen Mode at Native Resolutions

Traditional PDF viewers require two displays to be in "mirror" mode in order to show the same image on both. The -- maybe not so obvious -- disadvantage of this is that the higher-resolution display is forced to used the resolution of the lower-resolution one. By keeping the two displays at their respective native resolutions in "extended desktop" mode, your slides will always look great on either side.
